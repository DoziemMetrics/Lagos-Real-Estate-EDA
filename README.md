# Lagos Real Estate EDA
This project is an exploratory data analysis on the cost of houses in Lagos State, Nigeria. The dataset, provided by Quantum Analytics, is a CSV file containing information on various features of the properties. Using Python and libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib, I analyzed the data to discover what factors affected the price of houses the most in Lagos State.

##Installation
To run this project, you need to have Jupyter Notebook installed. To install Jupyter Notebook:

Download and install Anaconda from https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual.
Open Anaconda and launch Jupyter Notebook.
To import the required libraries, run the following commands in Jupyter Notebook:

python
Copy code
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
## Usage
To use this project, simply open the Jupyter Notebook file and run the cells. The code is well documented, and the output visualizations make it easy to understand the insights.

## Results
From the analysis, I discovered that certain utilities such as swimming pool and CCTV had little or no effect on the prices of property. I also found out that Lekki phase 1 was the most expensive neighborhood while Yaba was the least expensive. Despite Lekki phase 1 being expensive, landlords in that area didn't have basic utilities such as swimming pool and CCTV. I recommend for landlords to decongest neighborhoods like Ajah as houses there are too much and move closer to Lekki phase 1 as it had fewer houses and lots of spaces for building. I also recommend landlords look into building more mansions as there was only one mansion in the whole of Lagos according to the data.

# #Future Work
The major limitation of this project was that the dataset covered only a section of Lagos as many neighborhoods like Banana Island were not included. If in the future I find a more detailed dataset, I will not fail to update my project.
